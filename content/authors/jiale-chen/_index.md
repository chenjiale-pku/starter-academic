I have recently received my B.Sc., Summa Cum Laude in Computer Science and Technology from Turing Class, Peking University, advised by {{< staticref "https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/" "newtab" >}}Asst. Prof. Yuqing Kong{{< /staticref >}}. During my undergraduate years, I am fortunate to have worked closely with {{< staticref "http://procaccia.info/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Ariel Procaccia{{< /staticref >}} at Harvard University and {{< staticref "https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Jason Hartline{{< /staticref >}} at Northwestern University.

My research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical computer science and economics, with a goal to provide elegant explanations and practical guidance for social phenomena.
<!-- I'm particularly interested in algorithmic game theory and online algorithms. -->

<b>I will be joining {{< staticref "https://msande.stanford.edu/" "newtab" >}}Stanford MS&E{{< /staticref >}} as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2022!</b>

<!-- Here is my {{< staticref "file/cv.pdf" "newtab" >}}Curriculum Vitae{{< /staticref >}}. -->
