I am a final-year student at Turing Class, Peking University, advised by {{< staticref "https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/" "newtab" >}}Asst. Prof. Yuqing Kong{{< /staticref >}}. I am also fortunate to have worked closely with {{< staticref "http://procaccia.info/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Ariel Procaccia{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Jason Hartline{{< /staticref >}} during my undergraduate years.

My research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical computer science and economics, with a goal to provide elegant explanations and practical guidance for real social phenomena. I'm particularly interested in algorithmic game theory and online algorithms.
