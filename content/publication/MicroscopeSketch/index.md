abstract: "Approximate estimation of data streams provides real-time information for various applications. Estimation based on a sliding window has attracted much interest recently. The state-of-the-art approaches cannot achieve high accuracy, generality in algorithms and models, with limited memory usage, all at once. We propose MicroscopeSketch and its key technique, adaptive zooming. The key idea of adaptive zooming is to automatically zoom in or zoom out, to get a better view of the window. We theoretically analyze the error bound, the unilateral error, and the unbiased rounding error of MicroscopeSketch. We apply MicroscopeSketch to three tasks: frequency estimation, finding top-ùëò frequent items, and finding top-ùëò heavy changes. Compared to existing works, our experimental results show that the error of MicroscopeSketch is 363 times smaller in estimating the frequency and 15.2 smaller in finding top-ùëò items than the existing works. All the related source code is (anonymously) provided open-source on Github."
